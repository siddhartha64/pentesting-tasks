so when i first saw the the challange, i was kind shocked. i didnt have any idea,like "what can i do with an ip address?"    
and then found it that we should scan it. so i used basic namp command, i got all the open ports, and i know that http port can opened through browser, i got into <img width="1464" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-14 at 3 27 49 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128678545/232013354-d41b1b7d-bcb3-4abf-9ebf-e54640b2b7c2.png">
i spent 2 days in searching the flags in source code and found nothing. then i came to scanning again, i though there need some different find scan which can give me different information. i found different types of nmap scans like -sV,-p,-iL,-v and -A. nmap -A( aggressive) helped me to show much detailed information about the ip.in past i was trying to learn web explotiation i knew that robots.txt is used to show hidden details of the webpage and i opened it    <img width="558" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-14 at 3 40 30 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128678545/232016547-e7c455ae-f40e-4182-86ba-86976b1de582.png">
 


 and then i found my first flag using /fl4g.html<img width="1428" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-09 at 12 11 32 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128678545/232017816-555a0031-aaec-40bf-afa0-c4afaeb9eb71.png">
i opened the page and inspected it.


then i opened the next page using /site/tiny/tinyfilemanager.php<img width="537" alt="Screenshot 2023-04-14 at 3 50 51 PM" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/128678545/232019107-5a3b6d2a-eae2-45b8-acbe-640c61c76347.png">
 as i was trying to learn webexploit in past when i saw the web page, it was login page.looking at it i thought is this surely sql injection, and try some basic stuff which didnt work, then i asked to srikesh anna for help, anna told "not to make it complicated,learn regarding tinyfilemanger " then i found this
